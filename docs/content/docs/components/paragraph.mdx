<Callout type="info" title="Author's Note">
While headlines grab attention, paragraphs carry the message. This component is built to prioritize readability. By offering pre-defined scale sizes and refined line-heights (leading), the Paragraph component ensures that long-form content remains legible and aesthetically consistent with the rest of the AloeUI design system, effectively eliminating the visual "noise" of inconsistent body text.
